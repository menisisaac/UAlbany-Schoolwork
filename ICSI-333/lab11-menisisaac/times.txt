1. Both threads are accessing the global variable at same time so they are not using
the most up to date sum 

2. Task 2: 0.503 Total
Task 3: 0.015 Total

3. In task 2 each thread is waiting for the other one to add each number to the sum 500000 times,
while in task 3 they sum individually first and then only wait one to interact with the global sum
